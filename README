*textobj-motionmotion* is a Vim plugin to provide text objets to select a
piece of text bounded by the cursor positions of the following 2 motions.

For example, an asterisk (*) is used to denote the cursor position:
>
  ./runtime/doc/mo*tion.txt
<
"vim3bt." will select 'doc/motion' as follows:
(here (^) indicates the selected texts)
>
  ./runtime/doc/motion.txt
            ^^^^^^^^^^
<
Roughly speaking, this plugin makes an operator such that ["^x]c{motion} to
be able to respond ["x]cim{motion}{motion} (*im* is the default key mapping).
Hence the name "motionmotion" has been derived from.

Note that this plugin is far from complete. Please use *[range]* or
*Visual-mode* in the real world!

Requirements:
- Vim 7.2 or later
- |textobj-user| 0.3.8 or later  (vimscript#2100)
